# app-seed-tool TODO list

### Todo

- [ ] Update automated tests to test on nanox and nanosp
- [ ] Save memory by setting the SSKR word buffer (G_bolos_ux_context.sskr_words_buffer) to a sensible size. Maybe just store SSKR Bytewords as shorter two letter minimal Bytewords rather than a 4 letter Byteword plus spaace for each share. Convert minimal ByteWords back to four letter Bytewords just prior to display.

### In Progress

- [ ] Add Ledger Stax to list of devices app works on
  - [x] Add SSKR Generate option to Stax
  - [ ] Add SSKR Check option to Stax
  - [ ] Write SSKR to BIP39 functionality
  - [ ] Functional Test with 29-word SSKR shares
  - [ ] Functional Test with 46-word SSKR shares
