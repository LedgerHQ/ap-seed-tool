// Shamir Secret Sharing (based on SLIP-39)

/**

 * returns: the number of shares created, or a negative value if there was an error
 *
 * inputs: threshold: number of shares required to recover secret. Must be 1 <= threshold <=
 * share_count. share_count: number of shares to generate secret: array of bytes representing the
 * secret secret_length: length of the secret array. must be >= 16, <= 32 and even. result: place to
 * store the resulting shares. Must be able to hold share_count * secret_length bytes
